    "i.e statistics, sales trends, stock market price, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, mathematical finance and may more applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "such data may be collected at `regular time intervals`, such as monthly (eg. CPI), weekly (eg. Money supply), quarterly (eg. GDP) or annually (eg. Goverment Budget).\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series is used to predict the future values based on the previous observed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of prior time steps to predict the next time step is called the **sliding window method**. For short, it may be called the window method in some literature. In statistics and time series analysis, this is called a lag or lag method.\n",

    "1. `Trend:` shows the growth or decline in a time series(relatively smooth pattern) over a long period(more than a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Seasonality:` These are short term movements(within a year or shorter) occurring in data(regular intervals) due to seasonal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Irregularity:` These are sudden changes occurring in a time series which are unlikely to be repeated. \n",
    "   These variations are sometimes called residual or random components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Cyclic:` These are long term(more than a year) oscillations(rarely regular) occurring in a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Level:` Any time series will have a baseline(Level). To this baseline we add different components to form a complete time series. \n",
